## Fannie Mae Machine Learning Project
The notebooks within this repository demonstrate machine learning on the Fannie Mae mortgage datasets. These datasets are available online and have been made available to the public at the following link: (). 

We will be using two main frameworks to process the datasets for our machine learning models:
1. Pandas/Scikit-Learn framework
2. Pyspark/Spark MLlib framework
